## 1. What is the P/E Ratio?

The price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) is the ratio for valuing a company that measures its current share price relative to its per-share earnings (EPS). The price-to-earnings ratio is also sometimes known as the price multiple or the earnings multiple.

P/E ratios are used by investors and analysts to determine the relative value of a company's shares in an apples-to-apples comparison. It can also be used to compare a company against its own historical record or to compare aggregate markets against one another or over time.

A high P/E ratio could mean that a company's stock is over-valued, or else that investors are expecting high growth rates in the future.

Companies that have no earnings or that are losing money do not have a P/E ratio since there is nothing to put in the denominator.

There are two kinds of P/E ratios, Trailing P/E and Forward P/E, are used in practice.

The trailing P/E relies on past performance by dividing the current share price by the total EPS earnings over the past 12 months. It's the most popular P/E metric because it's the most objective – assuming the company reported earnings accurately. The trailing P/E ratio will change as the price of a company’s stock moves, since earnings are only released each quarter while stocks trade day in and day out.

The forward (or leading) P/E uses future earnings guidance rather than trailing figures. Sometimes called "estimated price to earnings," this forward-looking indicator is useful for comparing current earnings to future earnings and helps provide a clearer picture of what earnings will look like – without changes and other accounting adjustments.


## 2. P/E Ratio Formula and Calculation

To determine the P/E value, one simply must divide the current stock price by the earnings per share (EPS).

The current stock price (P) can be gleaned by plugging a stock’s ticker symbol into any finance website, and this concrete value reflects what investors must currently pay for a stock.

EPS comes in two main varieties. The first is a metric listed in the fundamentals section of most finance sites; with the notation "P/E (TTM)," where “TTM” is a Wall Street acronym for “trailing 12 months.” This number signals the company's performance over the past 12 months. The second type of EPS is found in a company's earnings release, which often provides EPS guidance. This is the company's best-educated guess of what it expects to earn in the future.
