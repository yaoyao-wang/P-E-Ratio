## 1. What is the P/E Ratio?

The price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) is the ratio for valuing a company that measures its current share price relative to its per-share earnings (EPS). The price-to-earnings ratio is also sometimes known as the price multiple or the earnings multiple.

P/E ratios are used by investors and analysts to determine the relative value of a company's shares in an apples-to-apples comparison. It can also be used to compare a company against its own historical record or to compare aggregate markets against one another or over time.

A high P/E ratio could mean that a company's stock is over-valued, or else that investors are expecting high growth rates in the future.

Companies that have no earnings or that are losing money do not have a P/E ratio since there is nothing to put in the denominator.

There are two kinds of P/E ratios - forward and trailing P/E - are used in practice.
