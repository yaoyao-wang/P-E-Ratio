//Step One: Initial Setting
//@version=4
study("P/E Ratio River", overlay = true)  //place the P/E Ratio graph in the same window

//Step Two: Parameter Setting
eps = financial(syminfo.tickerid, "EARNINGS_PER_SHARE", "TTM")  //locate all earning per share through the past 12 months

pe = close/eps  //The P/E Ratio equals the current close price divide by the earnings per share

pe_avg = sma(pe, 200)  //Calculate the simple moving average of the P/E Ratio for the last 200 days
pe_std = stdev(pe, 200)  //Calculate the standard deviation of the P/E Ratio for the last 200 days

pe_avg_river = pe_avg * eps 
pe_std_river1 = pe_avg * eps + 1* pe_std
pe_std_river2 = pe_avg * eps + 2 * pe_std
pe_std_river3 = pe_avg * eps - 1* pe_std
pe_std_river4 = pe_avg * eps - 2* pe_std

//Step Three: Plotting
plot(pe_avg_river, color = color.black) 
plot(pe_std_river1, color = color.blue)
plot(pe_std_river2, color = color.green)
plot(pe_std_river3, color = color.orange)
plot(pe_std_river4, color = color.red)
